# python-mails-app
the basic v1.0 app uses smtp to send mail to gmail, secures connection via starttls. 
before using, be sure to enable "less secure app access" to the account being used to send the mail from
i recommend creating a new account for this purpose
............................................................FUTURE PLANS...................................................................
1. securely send mail to the recipient with GMAIL api
2. encrypt the sent mail with assymetric ancryption 
3. see sent and recieved mails, if encrypted, decrypt the mail
4. build a GUI for the app
